Wordpress Featured Post Type Filter for Genesis

This widget plugin is based on Nick the Greek's "Genesis Featured Widget Amplified". It is intended to create a 
section on a page that showcases the post or custom posts, allowing show/hide of posts based on the selected post's 
category. The default will be "All", which means posts of all categories are to be shown.
